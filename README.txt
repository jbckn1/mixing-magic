Mixing Magic is a point-and-click game with two players working together to recreate the color, volume, temperature, and PH of a randomly 
generated beaker. In addition to the two players, a third person may join the game and spectate the playersâ€™ interactions to provide hints 
to the players. The finished product will include a functioning chat that allows participants to communicate with one another, different 
pages that will display various game information elements to each player depending on their role, and multiple tools to change the features
of an empty beaker.
