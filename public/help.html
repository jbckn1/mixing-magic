          <h1>Objective</h1>
          <p>There will be three total players. The game consists of two players interacting with a beaker and changing the color of the contents within, with the third able to have an omnipotent view and comment on the progress of the other two. Player 1 will be able to change the contents of the beaker by adding colored drops, water, an acid, or a base. Player 2 will be able to test the beaker to determine the contents within. They will be able to see a randomly determined beaker. Player 3 will be able to watch over the progress of the other two and make comments of encouragement. </p>
  
          <h1>Scientist</h1>
          <p>Player 1 will be able to add an acid or a base to alter the pH of the solution, distilled water to dilute the solution, and drops of food coloring to alter the color of the solution. They will have buttons to add acid, add base, add water, or add food coloring in order to match the levels Players 2 and 3 have coached them to reach.</p>
          <p>Goal:</p>
          <p>Player 1's goal is to create the correct solution after following the suggestions of Players 2 and 3.</p>
  
          <h1>Coach</h1>
          <p>Player 2 will see a randomly generated solution and try to coach Player 1 to recreate the solution. Player 2 will be able to test the solution to see the pH level, and will be able to communicate with Player 1 in order to guide them on what they should do. The communication will occur through the chat box on the right hand side of the screen. They will have buttons to test the pH level to see if it matches their given starting level.</p>
          <p>Goal:</p>
          <p>Player 2's goal is to coach Player 1 to accurately create the correct solution.</p>
  
          <h1>Spectator</h1>
          <p>Player 3 will be able to see the screens of the other two players in addition to a chat box. They will be able to use the chat box to offer words of encouragement or coach the other two players in their goal. </p>
          <p>Goal:</p>
          <p>Player 3's goal is to help the other two players by either providing coaching, or by offering words of encouragement.</p>
